            <b>Sail away on Dal Lake</b>
            There are lakes, and then there is<strong> Dal Lake</strong>. So yes, it is very unique because there is nothing quite like it anywhere. When in <i>Kashmir, the Dal Lake </i>experience often turns out to be a highlight for travellers. The beauty of this lake is unexpected, it is as if the lake has been touched by God. Surrounded by tall hills, it makes you feel like you are in heaven on earth. Then, there are those floating markets every morning, from where you can buy things. The whole thing is just extraordinary. This is also your chance to stay in a houseboat. Can you imagine waking up to those views?</p>
